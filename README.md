# Sadia's Game Jam

The player needs to catch the balls of hope that are falling. Once they reach five, their controls become inverted, and the ball starts to fall faster.

How does hope relate to the game?
In my game, hope is expressed by the falling, dark green balls. As you collect more balls, it becomes harder; the arrow keys become inverted and the ball drops faster. This action resembles hope since maintaining hope becomes harder as we face more difficult challenges in life.
