The player in the game catches the balls falling from the sky, which resemble hope. Once they reach five, their controls become inverted, and the ball starts to fall faster.

Hope is reflected in my game by the falling balls. As you collect more balls, the difficulty increases. This reflects hope since it becomes harder to maintain when facing difficult challenges.

## **Features**
